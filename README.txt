License plate lookup functionality has been added to the system. Sections for adding vehicles and adding inspections have been implemented. Currently, vehicle and inspection information can be viewed as a result of a license plate query. Insurance information has also been integrated into the system. An admin login has been added as well. UI improvements and work on the insurance information section are still in progress.
